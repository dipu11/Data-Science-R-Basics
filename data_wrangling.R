#To change a data table by adding a new column, or changing an existing one, we use the mutate() function.
#To filter the data by subsetting rows, we use the function filter().
#To subset the data by selecting specific columns, we use the select() function.
#We can perform a series of operations by sending the results of one function to another function using the pipe operator, %>%.

# adding a column with mutate

data("murders")
murders <- mutate(murders, rate = total / population * 100000)

# subsetting with filter
filter(murders, rate <= 0.71)

# selecting columns with select
new_table <- select(murders, state, region, rate)

# using the pipe
murders %>% select(state, region, rate) %>% filter(rate <= 0.71)

##creating data frame:
#By default, the data.frame() function turns characters into factors.  To avoid this, we utilize the stringsAsFactors argument and set it equal to false.
# creating a data frame with stringAsFactors = FALSE
